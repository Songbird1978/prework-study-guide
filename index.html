        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is the code language that means Hypertext Markup Language. </li>
          <br>
          <li>It lays down the structure of a webpage. </li>
          <br>
          <li>It contains elements such as: </li>
          <br>
            <li>Head</li>
            <li>Meta</li>
            <li>Body </li>
            <li>Lists</li>
            <li>Style</li>
            <li>Base</li>
            <li>Script</li>
          <br>
          <li>The most basic parts of a page structure are:</li>
          <br>
          <li> <b>Head</b> - The head element contains information about the webpage. This includes elements such as metadata (main language, performance, search criteria, viewing sizes (viewport), titles and character sets) and will usually not be seen by the audience. </li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Body</b> - The body element contains the information such as pictures, links, lists, paragraphs, text and headings inside sections </li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Section</b> - This is a way to group specific parts of the body of the page for further processing later.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Lists</b> - Are an element in which bullet points or numbered lists can be ordered or unordered. </li>
          <br>
          <li>Index.html is always the homepage of a site where the HTML is stored and links to other types of code files for the site such as CSS and Javascript.</li>
          <br>
          <li>We can use VS Code or other software to help us code and use the language and tags. </li>
          <br>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS means Cascading style sheets</li>
          <br>
          <li>They add styling information to your HTML code to improve the aesthetics of a page.</li>
          <br>
          <li>There are 3 types:  </li>
          <br>

              <li>In-line CSS = adds directly to a specific area of the HTML (eg. A heading)</li>
              <br>
              <li>Internal style sheet = CSS code embedded within the webpage (normally the [head]) </li>
              <br>
              <li>External style sheets = CSS code created in an external document but added as a [link] within the [head]) - this makes any changes easier to apply.</li>

          <br>
          <li>Separation of concerns is a term used to refer to the practice of keeping code responsibilities (design, features, procedures, style, functions) separate. In audio engineering terms, it is "good housekeeping"</li>
          <br>
          <li>External css documents are normally labelled style.css</li>
          <br>
          <li>Creation of CSS external sheet includes, margin & padding.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Margin = space around the outside of the element - buffer (invisible)</li>
          <br>
          <li>Padding = space around the content inside the element</li>
          <br>
          <li>Borders = thickness of the border around the box</li>
          <br>
          <li>CSS boxes can be styled:</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Inline</b> (principles applied on the same line) or;</li>
          <br>
          <li> <b>block</b> (principles applied on a new line)</li>
          <br>
          <li>DRY = do not repeat yourself = re-use or share pieces of code to simplify & reduce size of code</li>
          <br>
          <li>Use comma to group elements together that will be styled the same way</li>
          <br>

        <h2>GIT</h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a language used by GitHub to communicate between the shell and the cloud. It allows you to perform specific tasks related to your repositories or repos, which are basically projects. </li>
         <br>
          <li>There are commands based on:-</li>
          <br>
          <li>Setup = for configuring user information across platforms</li>
          <br>
          <li>Setup & Initialization = to clone repositories and choose directories to work on</li>
          <br>
          <li>Stage and Snapshot = to save versions of your work, comment and commit for review</li>
          <br>
          <li>Branch & Merge = to create new branches, check work done and merge with main directories</li>
          <br>
          <li>Inspect & Compare = inspecting what work you have done in comparison</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Javascript adds interactivity to a website. </li>
          <br>
          <li>Javascript file extension = .js</li>
          <br>
          <li>Variables (var =) are containers that store values</li>
          <br>
          <li>A semicolon at the end of the line is where a statement ends;</li>
          <br>
          <li> The javascript file is included at the end of the body part of the HTML file. </li>
          <br>
          <li>Javascript needs to be read AFTER the HTML coding is established.</li>
          <br>
          <li>In order to use JS - you must understand control flow. </li>
          <br>
          <li> Control flow is where actions will be performed in order, unless certain conditions are met. Truthy or Falsey answers will lead to the next action (question) until the actions are back on the same pathway. </li>
          <br>
          <li>A good way to understand control flow is to imagine a motorway with traffic. A car on the motorway will continue to drive forward on the motorway unless certain conditions are met, which require it to leave and then return to the flow. Those conditions could be leaving for food, toilet or petrol. IF those elements have been identified and then fulfilled, the car will return to the flow of the traffic on it's journey. </li>
          <br>
          <li> Using the IF +  statement, to propose different actions IF certain statements are truthy, then an action will occur. </li>
          <br>
          <li>Strings represent textual data. Strings cannot be modified.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Strings need to be contained within quotation marks.</li>
          <br>
          <li>An array is a function which enables more than one type of statement or piece of information to be stored ready for selection and further action. </li>
          <br>
          <li>To work with individual data within the array, we need to add a location by way of an index. </li>
          <br>
          <li>We can use a for loop to operate on each element in an array.</li>
          <br>
          <li>We can add functions using the function keyword</li>
          <br>
          <li>Functions are reusable blocks of code that contain instructions on how to perform a task.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Functions need to be named and be followed by parentheses.</li>
          <br>
          <li>We add curly brackets to contain the code for the task.</li>
          <br>
          <li>We can check our code is working using the console tab in a browser window.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Math.floor() and Math.random() can be used together to generate a random number.</li>
          <br>
          <li>To execute a function, we must call it in our code</li>
          <br>
          <li>ORDER MATTERS! - Javascript runs from top to bottom!</li>
