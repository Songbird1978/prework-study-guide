# Prework-Study-Guide

A study guide for course pre-work for the Skills for Life Bootcamp by Edx in Front End Web Development.

This project is about learning the basics of HTML, CSS & Javascript. As we learned, we noted the most important features of each language in order to assist other learners and ourselves in our discovery of coding and front end web development. 

This webpage includes a basic HTML structured page, which links to the CSS and Javascript pages in the code. CSS has changed the styling of the page. I chose to play around with different fonts and colours and change the margins to make it more presentable. 

The Javascript code was learning to add arrays and loops, features and functions. The program will run in a browser looking at console mode and it will randomly tell the user which topics to look at first, then the next, and so on, until all the topics have been read. 

Throughout the project we have also learned about Agile programming fundamentals, the power of Github for professionals and creatives and how to use the command line. 

The page solves the problem of keeping notes in one, easy to navigate, page and allows the learner and prospective users to benefit from the processes learned.
